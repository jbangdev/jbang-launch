WIP for enabling jbang:// protocol handler on macOS, Linux and Windows.

Very much early access - use at your own risk.

Once it works, you can use the `jbang://` protocol handler to open jbang scripts.

For now it only just shows the url in a window.

Try it with: 

link:jbang://run/env@jbangdev[]
