WIP for enabling jbang:// protocol handler on macOS, Linux and Windows.

Very much early access - use at your own risk.

Once it works, you can use the `jbang://` protocol handler to open jbang scripts.

For now it only just shows the url in a window.

Try it with: 

link:jbang://run/env@jbangdev[]




:releases-url: https://github.com/jbangdev/jbang-launch/releases/download/early-access

These builds are not signed, so things is not as smooth as it could be. See column Notes for details.
